Goldeneye - DDOS tool with HOIC and LOIC techniques 

## Key Enhancements:

1. **Better error handling** has been added for SSL verification.

2. **Random User Agents**: Similar to LOIC/HOIC, the tool now generates random User-Agent strings for each request.

3. **Randomized Methods**: The script can now switch between GET and POST methods randomly for each request, similar to HOIC's randomization techniques.

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3**: Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You can check by running: 
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   
2. **Install Required Packages** : The code uses built-in libraries, so no additional packages are required. However, if you encounter issues related to SSL, you may need to ensure you have OpenSSL installed.


1. ```vim goldeneye.py```
2. Copy Paste  {Copy and paste the code provided earlier into the file. Save and exit (in vim, press ```Esc```, then type ```:wq``` and hit ```Enter```).}
   
4. ```chmod +x goldeneye.py```  (Make this executable)


## Example to run the code:

  ``` 
  python3 goldeneye.py http://example.com
   ```
